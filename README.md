# Text-Mining
My work with Amazon Food reviews Kaggle Data
I recently undertook this a my academic project. The objective of the project was to uncover the topics being discussed and then understand the user sentiment associated with each of the topics.
I have used 'tm' for text processing. LDA, Cosine Similarity and Bigram have used for topic modeling and insight generation.
